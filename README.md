🧩 Project Overview
The project is divided into two main sections:

Section 1: Data Cleaning and ETL
Processed corrupted public health datasets from Nova Scotia's Open Data Portal
Implemented full ETL pipeline:
Data loading and inspection
Duplicate handling
Missing data treatment
Out-of-bounds data correction
Consistency checks
Data visualization

Section 2: COVID-19 Data Analysis
Analyzed global COVID-19 data using advanced techniques:
Data imputation with KNN
Dimensionality reduction using PCA
Distribution fitting
Entropy calculation
Correlation analysis
